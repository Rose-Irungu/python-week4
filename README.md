File Read & Write and Error Handling Challenge


Overview

This Python program reads the contents of a specified file, modifies the content, and writes the modified version to a new file. The program also handles common file-related errors, ensuring that users can gracefully handle issues like missing files or read/write failures.

Features

File Reading: Reads the content of an input file.

Content Modification: Modifies the content by adding a prefix.

File Writing: Writes the modified content to a new file.

Error Handling: Handles FileNotFoundError, IOError, and unexpected exceptions.

Installation

Ensure Python is installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).

Download the file_read_write.py script or copy the code into a .py file.

Usage

Run the Script:


Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Run the script using the command:

bash

Copy


Edit

python file_read_write.py

Enter the Filenames:

The script will prompt you to enter the filename to read from and the filename to write the modified content to.

Handle Errors:


If the file doesn't exist, or there are issues reading or writing the file, the program will print an appropriate error message.


Example Output

lua

Copy

Edit

Enter the filename to read from: input.txt

Enter the filename to write to: output.txt

Modified content has been written to output.txt.

Error Handling Example

javascript

Copy

Edit

Error: The file 'nonexistent_file.txt' was not found.

Code Explanation


File Read & Write:

The program opens the input file, reads its content, modifies it, and then writes the modified content to the output file.

Error Handling:

FileNotFoundError: Handles cases when the input file is not found.

IOError: Handles issues with reading or writing files.

Exception: Catches any other unexpected errors.

Conclusion

By the end of this module, you'll be skilled in managing files and handling exceptions in Python. This practice will help you build strong, robust applications that can handle real-world file operations with confidence.
